## Description

This program is a simple command-line interface (CLI) application that allows users to perform basic operations on black holes. The operations include:

1. Simulating the collision of two black holes
2. Simulating the rotation of a binary star system
3. Simulating the lensing effect of a black hole
4. Simulating the event horizon of two types of black holes, Schwarzschild and Kerr
5. Simulating the creation of a black hole from a star

The binary star system one doesn't fit the theme of black holes, but it's a cool simulation to have.

The simulation of the creation of a black hole doesn't work as intended. It's a work in progress.

## Requirements

python >= 3.8

**Setting Up the Environment**

* Windows: `./setup_Windows.bat`
* Linux/macOS: `./setup_Linux.sh`

These scripts will install required dependencies, and build a virtual environment for you if you don't have one.

## Running the Program

### CLI

1. Navigate to the `bin` directory: `cd bin`

2. Execute `python bh_operations.py [--help]` (use `python3` on Linux/macOS) in your terminal

    The `--help` flag displays available command-line arguments.

Here is an example of the black hole merger simulation:
